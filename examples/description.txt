This SSH log file shows typical authentication activity on a Linux system, capturing login attempts over several minutes. The logs record both successful and failed SSH connection attempts, including usernames, source IP addresses, and authentication outcomes. Each connection attempt generates multiple log entries that track the entire authentication process from initial connection through to either successful login or disconnection. The logs also show the system's security measures in action, including automatic disconnection after multiple failed attempts and warnings about potentially suspicious activity from certain IP addresses.
