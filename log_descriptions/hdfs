These logs show Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) activity, primarily focused on DataNode and NameNode operations managing data blocks. The logs record various block-related operations including block allocation, block storage updates in the NameSystem's block map, packet response terminations, and block transfers between nodes. Each log entry contains detailed information about block operations including block IDs, node IP addresses, port numbers, and block sizes (consistently 67108864 bytes or 64MB), showing the typical distributed storage operations of HDFS working across multiple nodes in the cluster. All entries start with a timestamp, process id, severity and component.
